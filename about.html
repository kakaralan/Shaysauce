                <h2>Born from an Obsession</h2>
                <p>Shay's Sauce was created by two people who have an insatiable taste for extremely hot sauce and put it on everything. Breakfast eggs? Hot sauce. Tacos? Hot sauce. Pizza? You better believe there's hot sauce on that.</p>
                <p>What started as a quest to find the perfect balance of heat and flavor turned into countless kitchen experiments, taste tests, and friendly debates about just how hot is too hot (spoiler: there's no such thing).</p>
                <p>Based out of Austin, Texas, we've turned our passion for heat into something we're proud to share. Every bottle is handcrafted in small batches because we believe that if you're going to put hot sauce on everything like we do, it better be the best.</p>
                <p>Whether you're drowning your morning scramble or adding kick to your midnight snack, Shay's Sauce brings the heat you crave with flavors you'll actually want to taste.</p>
